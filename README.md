# Introduction 
This application is a project for us to publish into our personal portfolios
Our objective is to create a working azure pipeline that then supports our web application
our web app is going to be something that can scan an ingredients list and tell someone 
if that list contains gluten or not

# Getting Started
Code Copy Instructions
1. Navigate to the Repos field on the azure.dev page
2. In the top right corner click the <Clone> button
3. With the HTTPS option selected click generate user credentials
4. Leave the username set to the default and copy the password
5. With the password copied, you can now select the IDE that you want to use
6. Once you click on the IDE that you are cloning from and it opens you will need to enter that password before
the git clone can complete
7. Once you enter that password you will now have full access to the Code repo

# Build and Test
When Trying to run the code on your own machine.
1. Open your terminal
2. using the cd command navigate to the Glutinous/glutinous directory (this is where the react was built)
/Glutinous/glutinous
3. in the terminal type npm start and it will create a locally hosted web app that allows you to view
current progress
